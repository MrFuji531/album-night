## Sourcing Tips

For J. Cole clips:
- Search "J Cole interview reactions"
- Podcast clips (Off The Record, etc.)
- Behind the scenes footage

What to look for:
- **Low scores (1-4)**: Skeptical looks, "mmm", confusion, disappointment
- **Mid scores (5-7)**: Nodding, "it's alright", neutral acknowledgment
- **High scores (8-10)**: Excitement, "that's fire", impressed reactions

For UI sounds:
- Use royalty-free sound effects
- Sites like freesound.org, mixkit.co
- Keep them short and punchy

## Optional

The app will work without audio files - it'll just log warnings to the console when sounds fail to load. Add files as you find good clips!
